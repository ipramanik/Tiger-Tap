import {Meta} from '@storybook/addon-docs/blocks';
import { MINIMAL_VIEWPORTS } from "@storybook/addon-viewport";

<Meta title="Service/AppearanceProvider" parameters={{
    viewMode: "docs",
    previewTabs: { canvas: { hidden: true } },

# AppearanceProvider
This component is useful if you want to subscribe on appearance updates:

```tsx
import { AppearanceProvider, Section } from "@twa-dev/mark42";

<AppearanceProvider>
  <Section title="Title">Content</Section>
</AppearanceProvider>
```

`Section` will change its style if `colorScheme` updates. That's because `AppearanceProvider` subscribes on
[TWA SDK `themeChanged` event](https://core.telegram.org/bots/webapps#events-available-for-web-apps) and passes
actual value down using [React context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html).

Almost every component in the UI section depends on the properties that `AppearanceProvider` provides.

## Properties
There are several properties that `AppearanceProvider` passes through the application.

#### `colorScheme`
This prop shares information about scheme of Telegram client. Value can be `light` or `dark`.

#### `platform`
There are lots of different Telegram clients: MacOS, Desktop, iOS, Android, web/z/ and so on. You probably want to
create different UX depending on platform. All platforms are described in `Platforms` type in
[@twa-dev/types](https://github.com/twa-dev/types) package.

#### `theme`
This property calculates from the `platform`. We believe that all platforms split into two groups: `apple` and
`material`. You can use this prop if you have the same feelings.

Now `AppearanceProvider` understands that you want to control its behavior, therefore it won't react to TWA SDK updates.

## Getting appearance properties in your own code
You can get actual appearance values via hooks:

```tsx
import { useColorScheme, useTheme, usePlatform, AppearanceProvider } from "@twa-dev/mark42";

const MyButton = (props) => {
  const theme = useTheme();
  const colorScheme = useColorScheme();
  const platform = usePlatform();

  return <button {...props} />
}

<AppearanceProvider>
  <MyButton>click me</MyButton>
</AppearanceProvider>
```

## Forcing appearance settings
You can pass your own appearance settings via props.

*We don't recommend to use this approach in production, because `theme`, `colorScheme` and `platform` should be calculated automatically.*

```tsx
import { AppearanceProvider, Section } from "@twa-dev/mark42";

<AppearanceProvider theme="material" colorScheme="light">
  <Section title="Title">Content</Section>
</AppearanceProvider>
```
